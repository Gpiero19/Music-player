## What I learned / Challenge

**Working with the Web Audio API:** Learned how to load, play, and control audio files dynamically in the browser. Managing playback, track history, and responsive controls was a key challenge.

**File handling for user-selected music:** Implemented functionality for users to select their own collection of music files, which taught me how to handle file inputs securely and display metadata dynamically.

**State management in vanilla JavaScript:** Managing the player state (current track, play/pause, history) without a framework strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling.

**Responsive design:** Ensured that the player UI works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices, which required planning layouts and testing different screen sizes.

**Integrating Vite for fast development:** Learned to set up a modern build tool with hot-reloading, speeding up development and making the project structure more maintainable.

**Problem-solving and debugging:** Handling edge cases like multiple files, simultaneous play, and updating the UI in real-time improved my debugging and troubleshooting skills.
